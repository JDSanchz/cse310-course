		<h1>W03 Teach: Team Project</h1>
    
        <h2>Team Project</h2>
        <p>You have been placed into a team with other students.&nbsp;The purpose of this team is to do three things:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Demonstrate your individual ability to contribute, communicate, and resolve conflicts with other students.</p></li>
        <li><p>Facilitate the requirement to develop a larger project using one or more of the discovery modules in this course.</p></li>
        <li><p>Provide an opportunity to share your own ideas, experiences, and conclusions with other students.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Project Requirements</h3>
        
        <p>Your team will propose a software project to complete over the remaining weeks of this course.  The project should have the following characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>The project should provide value to those who either use the software or benefit from the results of the software.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>The project should make use of one or more of the discovery modules.  It is acceptable to build upon something that a team member has already started in one of their own discovery modules.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The project should be large enough to provide a challenge over the remaining weeks of the course.&nbsp;However, the project should not be so large that it cannot be accomplished.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>The project should be interesting enough to showcase to employers in a resume, at a job fair, or during interviews.</p></li>
        <li><p>The project may use additional students from different departments (it can be an interdisciplinary project).</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The project must be configured in a public GitHub repository with a well-documented README.md file.</p>
        
        <p>During Week 13, another team in the class will be asked to review your project and provide feedback in the form of GitHub issues.  You will be required to respond to these issues before submitting your final project.</p>
        
        <h3>Schedule</h3>
        
        <p>The schedule for the project is as follows:</p>
        
        <table>

        <h3>Expectations</h3>
        
        <p>You are required to meet at least once together as a team each week.  The team contract will indentfiy team leadership responsibilties.</p>
        
        <p>You will need to dedicate time each week for project development.  You will still be completing individual discovery and language modules during this time.  It is very important that you manage your time between these different activities.</p>
        
        <h3>Rubric</h3>
        
        <p>Your team project will be given a grade according to the following rubric:</p>
        
        <table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 25%">Grade</th>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>100 (A)</td>
			  <td>Project is completed and demonstrates mastery of relevant discovery modules.  The README.md file is well-documented.  A potential employer would be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>89 (B+)</td>
              <td>Project is mostly completed and demonstrates understanding of the relevant discovery modules <strong>OR</strong> the README.md file is missing or lacking detail.  A potential employer might be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview. You should look for opportunities to improve your software and documentation.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>75 (C)</td>
              <td>Project is partially completed and demonstrates partial understanding of the releveant discovery modules.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>       
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>60 (D-)</td>
			  <td>Project was attempted but is mostly incomplete.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.  You should consider either retaking the course or spending time after the course to reattempt the project.  These actions are important to prepare you for future interviews.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0 (F)</td>
              <td>Project was not submitted.</td>

			  <td>60 (D-)</td>
			  <td>Your team agreed that you contributed little to the implementation of the project.  Your participation in team meetings was lacking.  You kept very few of your commitments.</td>
