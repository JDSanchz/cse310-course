		<h1>W03 Teach: Create Team Project Plan</h1>
    
        <p>You have been organized into teams.  During the first Sprint, each team needs to decide on a project and submit a Team Project Plan.  The <a href="../modules/team_project_description_campus.html" target="_blank">Team Project Description</a> provides the details of the team project.</p>
        
        <h2>Team Project Plan</h2>
        
        <ol>
			<li><p>Download <a href="cse310_project_plan_campus.docx">cse310_project_plan_campus.docx</a>.</p></li>
			<li><p>Fill all parts of the project plan include proposal, schedule in Trello, and identification of the project roles.
			<li><p>The team leader should submit this completed report in I-Learn for the team.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>You may start work on your project after submitting your plan.  However, you may be asked by your teacher to modify your proposed project.  You should respond to feedback from your teacher quickly to get an approved project plan. </p>
