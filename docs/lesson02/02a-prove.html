		<h2>Instructions</h2>
        
        <p>This assignment <strong>must be completed individually</strong> to ensure you are meeting all course outcomes.  You should not complete this assignment with a group.  If you obtain help from a tutor, the tutor should help you understand principles but should not help you complete these problems.  It is an Honor Code violation to obtain answers for these problems from others, including using the internet (such as sites that allow students to share their solutions or public repositories from previous students).</p>
