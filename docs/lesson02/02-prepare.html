        <h2>Module #1 (Language)</h2>
        
        <p>This week you will be starting your first language module.  If you don't know Python yet, you are encouraged to complete the Python Language Module.  Several of the discovery modules in this course have guidance to use Python.  You should reflect back on the Course Goals Survey you took at the beginning of the semester to review which module you want to complete.  The <a href="../modules/module_summary.html" target="_blank">Module Summary</a> contains all the modules to select from.  You should complete the module plan for your selected module in the <a href="02-prove.html" target="_blank">W02-Prove</a> assignment as quickly as possible.</p>

		<h2>Finding a Job: Networking</h2>
		
		<p>The “Finding a Job” readings in this course will all come from the Self Reliance Services (SRS) <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/ldsorg/topics/self-reliance/find-a-better-job-na-eng.pdf" target="_blank">“Find a Better Job” manual</a> published by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  You should download this manual for use in this course.  You will complete a reading and a Prove assignment related to employment every other week.</p>
        
        <p>The SRS manual is intended for use in a group, but you will use it individually.  Activities and discussions in the reading should be done individually.</p>
        
        <p>This week, you should complete the following reading:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>Chapter 2, Introduction, Page 25</p></li>
        <li><p>Chapter 2, Section 1—How People Really Get Jobs, Page 26</p></li>
            <ul>
            <li><p>You should watch the video <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/video/2016-12-0002-how-jobs-are-really-filled" target="_blank">How Jobs Are Really Filled</a> referenced in this section.</p></li>
            <li><p>In the activity, after you make the list of potential contacts within 60 seconds, share with a friend or family member and ask for some sources or specific names you may have missed.</p></li>
            </ul>
        <li><p>Chapter 2, Section 2—Talk to Everyone, Pages 27–29</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Additionally, spend a few minutes looking at the networking resources at the <a href="https://www.byui.edu/career-center">BYU-Idaho Career Center</a>.</p>
