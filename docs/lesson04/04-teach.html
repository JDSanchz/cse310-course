	    <h2>Team Meeting</h2>
        
        <p>You need to meet together as a team at least once this week.  Your recommended agenda is as follows:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><p>Opening prayer.</p></li>
        <li><p>Agree on a proposed project and complete the project plan together.</p></li>
        <li><p>Identify what needs to be researched and make assignments to team members.  It is recommended that team members write code (proof of concept) to demonstrate the results of their research.  While not required, it is recommended that code written as part of this research be put in the individual's personal software repository within GitHub with documentation for future use.</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>You may need to refer back to the Team Project description in <a href="../lesson03/03-teach.html">W03 Teach</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Project Plan</h2>
