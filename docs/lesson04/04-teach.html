	    <h2>Team Meeting</h2>
        
        <p>You need to meet together as a team at least once this week.  Your recommended agenda is as follows:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><p>Opening prayer.</p></li>
        <li><p>Agree on a proposed project and complete the project plan together.</p></li>
        <li><p>Identify what needs to be researched and make assignments to team members.  It is recommended that team members write code (proof of concept) to demonstrate the results of their research.  While not required, it is recommended that code written as part of this research be put in the individual's personal software repository within GitHub with documentation for future use.</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>You may need to refer back to the <a href="../modules/team_project_summary.html" target="_blank">Team Project Description</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Project Plan</h2>
        
        <h3 style="counter-reset: h3">Instructions</h3>
        
        <ol>
        <li><p>Download <a href="cs246_project_plan.docx">cs246_project_plan.docx</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Provide a detailed description of your proposed project, including specific requirements that the software will fulfill.  The proposal should also identify the language and discovery modules that you will be using to implement the software.</p></li>
        <li><p>Identify a high-level schedule for your project, including researching, implementing features, and testing.</p></li>
        <li><p>Identify risks that the team will need to resolve together early in the project.</p></li>
        <li><p>Select a member of your team to be the team leader.  The team leader is responsible for scheduling and conducting all team meetings.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>You may start work on your project after submitting your plan.  However, you may be asked by your teacher to modify your proposed project.  You should respond to feedback from your teacher quickly to get an approved project plan. </p>
        
        <h3>Rubric</h3>
        
	    <p>This is both a team grade and a <strong>pass/fail</strong> grade.  If the project plan is incomplete or lacking detail, then a fail will be given.</p>
        
        <h3>Submission</h3>

		<ul>
