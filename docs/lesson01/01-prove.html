		<h1>W01 Prove: Individual Assignment</h1>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
        
        <p>This assignment <strong>must be completed individually</strong> to ensure you are meeting all course outcomes.  You should not complete this assignment with a group.  If you obtain help from a tutor, the tutor should help you understand principles but should not help you complete these problems.  It is an Honor Code violation to obtain answers for these problems from others, including using the internet (such as sites that allow students to share their solutions or public repositories from previous students).</p>
		
        <h3>Personal Software Portfolio</h3>
        
        <p>When completing this assignment, you are encouraged to review the <a href="TBD" target="_blank">GitHub video</a> that was referenced in the preparation reading.</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><p>Create a GitHub account by applying for the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank">GitHub Student Developer Pack</a>.  The Student Developer Pack can be applied to existing GitHub accounts as well.</p></li>
        <li><p>Edit your profile to include a picture, name and brief bio (for example, “Computer Science Student at BYU-Idaho”).</p></li>
        <li><p>Using Visual Studio Code, write a program in any programming language that you already know.  The program should be short, and its functionality is up to you.  The code should be placed in its own folder.</p> </li>
        <li><p>In addition to your code, create an additional file called README.md.  This file is used to document your software using Markdown language.  You can learn more about Markdown from <a href="https://www.markdowntutorial.com/" target="_blank">Markdowntutorial.com</a> and from this <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">Markdown reference guide</a>.  The README.md document should include the following:</p></li>
            <ul>
                    <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to set up the development environment, including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to build (if applicable), execute, and use your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Screenshots showing the results of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>   
            </ul>
            <li><p>Publish your code (with the README.md) into GitHub.</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Inventory and Goals Survey</h3>
        
        <p>The purpose of the Inventory and Goals Survey is to identify your current knowledge and the goals that you want to accomplish this semester.  You will use the survey to identify which modules you want to complete in the upcoming weeks.  You will also use the survey to identify the first repository you created in your personal software portfolio above.</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><p>Download the <a href="cse310_inventory_goals_survey.docx" target="_blank">cse310_inventory_goals_survey.docx</a> and fill out the Start of Semester section only.  You will fill out the rest of the document at the end of the semester as part of the <a href="../lesson14/14-prove.html"  target="_blank">W14 Prove</a> assignment.</p></li>
        <li><p>Record the link to the first repository you created in your personal software portfolio at the end of the survey.</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Submission</h2>
		<p>You need to submit the following for this assignment:</p>
