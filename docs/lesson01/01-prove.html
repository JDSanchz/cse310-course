		<h1>W01 Prove: Individual Assignment</h1>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
        
        <p>This assignment <strong>must be completed individually</strong> to ensure you are meeting all course outcomes.  You should not complete this assignment with a group.  If you obtain help from a tutor, the tutor should help you understand principles but should not help you complete this assignment.  It is an Honor Code violation to obtain previously developed solutions from others, including using internet sites that share course work previously submitted by other students.</p>
		
        <h3>Personal Software Portfolio</h3>
        
        <p>When completing this assignment, you are encouraged to review the <a href="https://video.byui.edu/media/0_v2afnpby" target="_blank">GitHub Workshop video</a> that was referenced in the preparation reading.</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><p>Create a GitHub account by applying for the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank">GitHub Student Developer Pack</a>.  The Student Developer Pack can be applied to existing GitHub accounts as well.</p></li>
        <li><p>Edit your profile to include a picture, name and brief bio (for example, “Computer Science Student at BYU-Idaho”).</p></li>
        <li><p>Using Visual Studio Code, write a very simple "Hello World" program in any programming language that you already know.  In the previously mentioned video, Python is used.  You are encouraged to complete this program in Python.  The code should be placed in its own folder.</p> </li>
        <li><p>In addition to your code, create an additional file called README.md.  This file is used to document your software using Markdown language.  You can learn more about Markdown from <a href="https://www.markdowntutorial.com/" target="_blank">Markdowntutorial.com</a> and from this <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">Markdown reference guide</a>.  The README.md document should include the following:</p></li>
            <ul>
                    <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to set up the development environment, including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to build, execute, and use your program as applicable for your development environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Screenshots showing the results of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>   
            </ul>
        <li><p>Publish your code (with the README.md) into a public GitHub repository.  You will need to install <a href="https://git-scm.com/download" target="_blank">git</a> to give Visual Studio Code that capability to publish to GitHub.  You will provide the public repository GitHub link in the Course Goals Survey (see below).</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Course Goals Survey</h3>
        
        <p>The purpose of the Course Goals Survey is to identify your current knowledge and the goals that you want to accomplish this semester.  You will use the survey to identify which modules you want to complete in the upcoming weeks.  At the end of the semester, you will complete the same survey again and observe how you have changed over the semester.</p>
        
        <p>The last question in the survey will ask for the link to the first repository you added to your personal software repository.</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><p>Download the <a href="cs246_course_goals_survey.docx" target="_blank">cs246_course_goals_survey.docx</a></p></li>
        <li><p>Complete the survey and provide the link to the first repository you added to your personal software repository.</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Submission</h2>
		<p>You need to submit the following for this assignment:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><code>cs246_course_goals_survey.docx</code></p></li>
		</ul>
        
        <h2>Rubric</h2>
        
	    <p>This is a <strong>pass/fail</strong> assignment.  If any part of the survey or initial repository is incomplete or lacking detail, then you will receive a fail.</p>
