        <h3>What is a Portfolio</h3>
		
		<p>It is often said that if a person wants to become a great piano player, then the person needs to practice the piano.  The same can be said for a computer programmer.  It is not enough for a student of programming to implement the problem sets given to them during their academic experience.  When we interview for a job, the potential employer will be interested in what you have created unique from other students.  Often times the best thing to discuss is relevant employment.  However, if we are seeking our first job or if we are seeking a job that requires new technical skills, we will need to have something to discuss and showcase.  A "Personal Software Portfolio" is a collection of our creative software work.  This portfolio does not contain the solutions to problems that all of our peers solved in previous classes.  Rather, this portfolio contains the results of our scientfic experimentation with technology.  We should reflect on the scientific process as shown below:</p>
        
        <figure>
		<img src="scientific_method.jpeg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Shows a flow chart representing the scientific method.  The process goes: Problem Statement, Research, Hypothesis, Experiment, and then Conclusions.  If the conclusions suggest that the problem is solved, then we can finish knowing we have the answer.  If the conclusions suggest that the problem is not solved, then we return back up to the Research step."/>
        <figcaption>Scientific Method</figcaption></figure>
        <p>Our portfolio should contain all the software we have created in our effort to either learn new technologies or solve new problems.  The code by iteself is insufficient when we consider the scientific method.  The portfolio must represent the research and conclusions that we have obtained through the process.  Each piece of software that we include within our portfolio must contain documentation. &nbsp;The documentation serves many purposes including:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Potential employers will understand the purpose and scope our software including the breadth of knowledge that we have regarding the subject.</p></li>
        <li><p>Other engineers can learn from our work and potentially collaborate with us on improvements.</p></li>
        <li><p>We can recall where we stopped our investigation so that later we can continue with our learning.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Creating a Portfolio</h3>
        
        <p>The software we put in our portfolio must be suitable for sharing with everyone.  Solutions to specific academic problems and proprietary solutions from our company should not be included.  In this course, however, we will be asked to create content that is a very appropriate for your portfolio.  Everything that we create in this course will be required to be shared in a public repository.  The prove assignment this week will be to establish a well documented GitHub account.  Once our account is established, we will create and add our first piece of software demonstrating a programming language that we already know.  In addition to publishing our code, we will also publish detailed documentation (i.e. a README.md file).</p>   
        
        <p>Putting code into GitHub requires the use of the Git program.  Visual Studio Code already comes with Git installed.  The following <a href="TBD">video</a> will walk through process of creating a "Hello World" code example and publishing it within GitHub.  You can also read more from these websites:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol" target="_blank">Using Version Control in VS Code - Microsoft</a> (official website)</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github">Working with GitHub in VS Code - Microsoft</a> (official website)</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Planning Content for a Portfolio</h3>
        
        <p>This course has several <a href="../modules/module_summary.html" target="_blank">modules</a> for us to choose from to develop our programming skills.  Since we will have to choose two language modules and four discovery modules from the list, we will need to have a way of choosing the best ones.  To faciliate this process, we will each create a learning plan.  The template for the plan can be found in the prove assignment.  This plan is a living document.  We will need to update this document everytime we complete a module for this course.  At the end of the course, this document will summarize where we started, what we achieved, and where we will go next.  A grade will be given at the end of the semester for our learning plan.</p>
