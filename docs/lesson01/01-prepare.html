		<h2>Personal Software Portfolio</h2>
        
        <h3>What is a Portfolio?</h3>
		
		<p>It is often said that if a person wants to become a great piano player, then that person needs to practice the piano.  The same can be said for a computer programmer.  It is not enough for a student of programming to implement the problem sets given to them during their academic experience.  When we interview for a job, the potential employer will be interested in what we have created that is unique from other students.  Usually, the best thing to discuss is relevant employment.  However, if we are seeking our first job or if we are seeking a job that requires new technical skills, we will need to have something to discuss and showcase.  A personal software portfolio is a collection of our creative software work.  This portfolio does not contain the solutions to problems that all of our peers solved in previous classes.  Rather, this portfolio contains the results of our scientfic experimentation with technology.  We should reflect on the scientific process, as shown below:</p>
        
        <figure>

The process goes: Problem Statement, Research, Hypothesis, Experiment, and then Conclusions.  If the conclusions suggest that the problem is solved, then we can finish, knowing we have the answer.  If the conclusions suggest that the problem is not solved, then we return back up to the Research step."/>
        <figcaption>Scientific Method</figcaption></figure>
        <p>Our portfolio should contain all the software we have created in our effort to either learn new technologies or solve new problems.  The code by itself is insufficient when we consider the scientific method; the portfolio must represent the research and conclusions that we have obtained through the process.  Each piece of software that we include within our portfolio must have documentation. The documentation serves many purposes, including the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Potential employers will understand the purpose and scope of our software, including the breadth of knowledge that we have regarding the subject.</p></li>
        <li><p>Other engineers can learn from our work and potentially collaborate with us on improvements.</p></li>
        <li><p>We can recall where we stopped our investigation so that later we can continue with our learning.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Creating a Portfolio</h3>
        <p>The software we put in our portfolio must be suitable for sharing with everyone.  Solutions to specific academic problems and proprietary solutions from our company should not be included.  In this course, however, we will be asked to create content that is very appropriate for our portfolio.  Everything that we create in this course will be required to be shared in a public repository.  The Prove assignment this week will be to establish a well-documented GitHub account.  Once our account is established, we will create and add our first piece of software, demonstrating a programming language that we already know.  In addition to publishing our code, we will also publish detailed documentation (as a README.md file).</p>
        <p>Putting code into GitHub requires the use of the <a href="https://git-scm.com/download" target="_blank">Git</a> program.  Visual Studio Code will both detect your Git installation and provide integration.  This video will walk through the process of creating a “Hello World” code example and publishing it within GitHub:  <a href="TBD" target="_blank">Video Title</a>.  You can also read more from these websites:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol" target="_blank">Using Version Control in VS Code - Microsoft</a> (official website)</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github" target="_blank">Working with GitHub in VS Code - Microsoft</a> (official website)</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Planning Content for a Portfolio</h3>
        
        <p>This course has several modules for us to choose from to develop our programming skills (<a href="../modules/module_summary.html" target="_blank">Module Summary</a>).  Since we will have to choose two language modules and four discovery modules from the list, we will need to have a way of choosing the most appropriate ones.  To faciliate this process, we will each complete a Course Goals Survey.  The survey will help us plan which modules we should complete.  We can change our minds during the semester, but it's good to think about which modules will help us learn the most.  At the end of the course, we will take the Course Goals Survey again and observe how we have changed.</p>
        
        <p>Each module that we complete will require us to create a plan for learning the material.  The module instructions will give us an overview, requirements, guidance, and a rubric.  Several suggested websites will be given.  Detailed instructions will not be given.  Our plan will be essential for completing each module in the two weeks allowed.  Each module will also provide optional opportunities to extend our learning (for bonus points). </p>
