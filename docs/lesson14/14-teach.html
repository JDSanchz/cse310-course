		<h1>W14 Teach: Team Project</h1>
        
	    <h2>Team Meeting</h2>
        
        <p>You do not need a team meeting this week.  You should coordinate together to finish the project as needed.</p>
        
        <p>It would be helpful to remind your team members to complete <a href="14-prove.html" target="_blank">W14-Prove</a> before the end of the semester.  This last assignment should be completed individually and will include confidential assessments of the team project.</p>
        
        <p>You are also encouraged to make a copy (if the repository was not created in your account) of the project by doing a fork in GitHub (<a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/" target="_blank">GitHub Forking</a>).</p>
        
        <p>There is no team deliverable this week.</p>
