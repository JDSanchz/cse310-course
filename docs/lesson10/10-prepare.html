        <h2>Language Module #2</h2>
        
        <p>This week we will be starting our second language module.  We should reflect back on the Course Goals Survey we took at the beginning of the semester to review which module we planned to complete.  The <a href="../modules/module_summary.html" target="_blank">Module Summary page</a> may also be useful to review.  We should complete the module plan for our selected module in the <a href="10a-prove.html" target="_blank">W10 Prove A</a> assignment as quickly as possible.</p>        
        
		<h2>Finding a Job: Interviewing—Part 1</h2>
		
        <p>The Self Reliance Services (SRS) <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/ldsorg/topics/self-reliance/find-a-better-job-na-eng.pdf" target="_blank">“Find a Better Job” manual</a> is intended for use in a group, but we will use it individually.  Activities and discussions in the reading should be done individually.</p>

        <ul>
