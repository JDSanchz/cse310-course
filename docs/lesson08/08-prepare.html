        <h2>Discovery Module 3</h2>
        
        <p>This week we will be starting our third discovery module.  We should reflect back on the Inventory and Goals survey we took at the beginning of the semester to review which module we planned to complete.  The <a href="../modules/module_summary.html" target="_blank">module summaries</a> may also be useful to review.  We should complete the module plan for our selected module in the <a href="08a-prove.html" target="_blank">prove</a> assignment this week as quickly as possible.</p>        
	
		<h2>Finding a Job: Resumes</h2>
		
        <p>The <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/ldsorg/topics/self-reliance/find-a-better-job-na-eng.pdf" target="_blank">Self Reliance Services (SRS) "Find a Better Job"</a> manual is intended for use in a group but we will use it individually.  Activities and Discussions in the reading should be done individually.</p>
        
        <p>This week, we should complete the following reading:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>Chapter 5, Introduction, Pages 77-78</p></li>
        <li><p>Chapter 5, Section 1 - Three Simple Principles, Page 79</p></li>
        <li><p>Chapter 5, Section 2 - Resumes, Pages 79-85 </p></li>
            <ul>
            <li><p>In the first activity, we will need to first find an entry level or internship job that we are interested in.  We can search on a website like <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/">GlassDoor</a>, <a href="https://www.indeed.com/">Indeed</a>, or <a href="https://byui.joinhandshake.com/login">Handshake</a>.  We can find more resources at the <a href="https://www.byui.edu/career-center">BYU-Idaho Career Center</a>.</p></li>
            <li><p>In the second activity, share our accomplishments with two or more friends or family members and ask for feedback.</p></li>
            </ul>
        <li><p>Chapter 5, Conclusion, Page 89</p>
        </li>
            <ul>
            <li><p>We should watch the video <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/video/2016-12-0006-better-written-materials" target="_blank">"Better Written Materials"</a> referenced in this section.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Additionally, spend a few minutes looking at the resume resources at the <a href="https://www.byui.edu/career-center">BYU-Idaho Career Center</a>.</p>
