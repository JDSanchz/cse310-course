        <ol>
        <li><p>Opening prayer.</p></li>
        <li><p>Each team member should report on their assignments.</p></li>
        <li><p>Make assignments for team members to continue implementing different parts of the software.  You should refer to the schedule that your team wrote in the project plan.  Next week is the last full week of development.</p></li>
        <li><p>Discuss technical risks and team concerns together and make plans to resolve them.</p></li>
        <li><p>Review the README.md file and make assignments to ensure that it is completed.</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>You may need to refer back to the <a href="../modules/team_project_summary.html" target="_blank">Team Project Description</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Project Demo</h2>
        
        <h3 style="counter-reset: h3">Instructions</h3>
        
        <ol>
        <li><p>Download <a href="cs246_project_demo.docx">cs246_project_demo.docx</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Identify your GitHub repository in the document.</p></li>
        <li><p>Your teacher will ask you to either present a live demo or a video for your project.  All team members must participate in the demonstration.  The demo should be 5â€“7 minutes long.  All team members should be dressed professionally.  If a video is required, provide a link to the video (no passwords should be used) in the document.</p></li>
        <li><p>Identify the remaining tasks your team has to complete for the project.  Ensure that all tasks are equally assigned to all team members.</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <!--
        <p>Another team will be asked to provide feedback on your project, including artifacts in GitHub, after your demo.  Feedback will be provided as GitHub issues.  The document will be shared with the other team so they can access the public repository and the video (if not presented live in class).</p>
        -->
        
        <h3>Rubric</h3>
        
	    <p>This is both a team grade and a <strong>pass/fail</strong> grade.  If the demo is not performed, then a fail will be given.</p>

		<ul>
