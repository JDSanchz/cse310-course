	    <h2>Team Meeting</h2>
        
        <p>You need to meet at least once together as a team this week.  Your recommended agenda is as follows:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><p>Opening prayer.</p></li>
        <li><p>Each team member should report on their assignments.</p></li>
        <li><p>Make assignments for team members to continue implementing different parts of the software.  Ensure that the README.md file has been drafted.  You should refer to the schedule that your team wrote in the project plan.</p></li>
        <li><p>Discuss technical risks and team concerns together and make plans to resolve them.</p></li>  
        <li><p>Make preparations for the project demo next week.</p></li>
        </ol>
