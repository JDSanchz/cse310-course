	    <h2>Team Meeting</h2>
        
        <p>You need to meet at least once together as a team this week.  Your recommended agenda should be as follows:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><p>Opening prayer.</p></li>
        <li><p>Each team member should report on their assignments.</p></li>
        <li><p>Follow up on assignments for team members to complete the project.  Ensure that the README.md file is completed.  The last day to work on the project is the last day of the semester.  No formal delivery of the project will be made; the teacher will access your public GitHub repository directly.</p></li>
        <!--            
        <li>
          <p>Respond to any GitHub issues raised by other teams. You should monitor this throughout the week so that your team can address any issues added late. If possible (not required), make plans to make corrections to your project.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Remind all team members to individually review the project that was assigned to them this week (<a href="13b-teach.html" target="_blank">13B Teach</a>).</p></li>
        -->
        <li><p>Remind your team members to complete <a href="14-prove.html" target="_blank">W14 Prove</a> before the end of the semester.  This last assignment should be completed individually and will include confidential assessments of the team project.</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>You may need to refer back to the <a href="../modules/team_project_description.html" target="_blank">Team Project Description</a>.</p>
        
        <p>There is no team deliverable this week.</p>
