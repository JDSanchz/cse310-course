	    <h2>Team Meeting</h2>
        
        <p>You need to meet at least once together as a team this week.  Your recommended agenda should be as follows:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><p>Opening Prayer</p></li>
        <li><p>Each team member should report on their assignments.</p></li>
        <li><p>Follow-up on assignments for team members to complete the project.  Ensure that the README.md file is completed.  The last day to work on the project is the last day of the semester.  No formal delivery of the project is made.  The teacher will directly access your public GitHub repository.</p></li>
        <!--            
        <li>
          <p>Respond to any GitHub issues raised by other teams. &nbsp;You should monitor this throughout the week so that your team can address any issues added late. &nbsp;If possible (not required), make plans to make corrections to your project.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Remind all team members to individually review the project that was assigned to them this week (<a href="13b-teach.html" target="_blank">13B-Teach</a>).</p></li>
        -->
        <li><p>Remind all team members to individually complete the Individual Project Report (<a href="../lesson14/14-teach.html">14-Teach</a>).  This report is confidential and should not be shared with other team members.  The report is due on the last day of the semester.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remind all team members to individually complete the Inventory and Goals Survey - Revisited (<a href="../lesson14/14-prove.html">14-Prove</a>).  This survey is an opportunity to show your growth over the semester.  The survey is due on the last day of the semester.</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>You may need to refer back to the Team Project Description in <a href="../lesson03/03-teach.html">03-Teach</a>.</p>
        
        <p>There is no team deliverable this week.</p>
