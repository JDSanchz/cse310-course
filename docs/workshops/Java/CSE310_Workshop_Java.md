## Development Environment

There are two ways to install Java:

* Oracle JDK
  * Requires license for commerical use
  * https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
* OpenJDK
  * Open Source - GNU Public License
  * https://openjdk.java.net/
  * Does not have an installation.  Uncompress the zip file and put the folder where you want it.

Java code is compiled using the `javac` tool.  Look in the `bin` directory of your java installation for this tool.  If you are running from the command line, you will want to add this to your environment path.  This example compiles three `.java` files into `.class` files.

```bash
javac hello.java goodbye.java start.java
```

The `.class` files are object code which is interpreted using the java virtual machine.  After compiling into `.class` files, the software can now be executed on any operating system.  When you download Java, you have to select the download that matches your operating system so that the `java` tool will interpret the `.class` files correctly.  To run your code you use the `java` tool.

```bash
java Start.class
```

In your Java code, one of the classes will have a `main` function that defines where the code begins.  In our example above, the `Start` class has the `main` function.  When running the `java` tool, we specify the class that has the `main` function to run.

## Java Syntax

### Classes

In Java, everything is a class.  Code does not exist without a class.  

```java
public class Hello {

}
```

At least one of your classes must have a static `main` function to describe how the program should begin.

```java
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

A class can have attributes and functions.  All parts of a class can be declared with scope access of either:
* public - Accessible by any class
* private - Accessible only in the class
* protected - Accessible only in the class or derived classes (inheritance)
* If no access is given, then this is called "Package Scope" which is accessible by all classes in the package (or folder)

A class should also have a constructor to initialize attributes in the class.

```java
public class Box {
    private float length;
    private float width;

    public Box(float length, float width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    public float getArea() {
        return length * width;
    }
}
```

A useful function to override in Java is the `toString` function.  This function is used to represent the object as a string.

```java
public class Box {
    ...

    public String toString() {
        String result = "Box[w=" + width + ",l=" + length + "]";
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Objects and Memory

All objects of classes are dynamically allocated on the heap.  Java uses garbage collection to free unused memory.  The `new` operator is used to create objects.  

```java
Box box1 = new Box(3.2f, 1.8f);
Box box2 = new Box(1.2f, 4.2f);
float totalArea = box1.getArea() + box2.getArea();
```

When you pass an object to a function, it passes a copy of the memory addresses.  This means that the receiving function can affect changes on the object (e.g. by calling a funciton on it).

### Data Structures

The Java API is very extensive including support for things such as data structures, networking, files, and graphics.  Common data structures include:
* ArrayList - Implements a dynamic array with support of indicies
* LinkedList - Implements a doubly linked list useful for queues
* HashMap - Implements a key/value pair lookup table

When creating a data structure object, Java requires that you specify that data type that it will hold.  This uses a syntax technique called templates.

```java
ArrayList<Box> boxes = new ArrayList<>();
boxes.add(new Box(9.9f, 1.1f));
boxes.add(new Box(7.2f, 8.9f));
boxes.add(new Box(2.4f, 3.0f));
```

### Loops

Java supports counter based loops using the `for` statement.

```java
int sum = 0;
for (int i=1; i<=10; i++) {
    sum += i;
}
```

Java also supports iterators for data structures.  

```java
float totalArea = 0.0f;
for (Box b : boxes) {
    totalArea += b.getArea();
}
```
