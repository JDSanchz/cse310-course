	    <h2>Team Meeting</h2>
        
        <p>You need to meet at least once together as a team this week.  Your recommended agenda should be as follows:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><p>Opening Prayer</p></li>
        <li><p>Each team member should report on their assignments.</p></li>
        <li><p>Make assignments for team members to continue implementing different parts of the software.  You should refer to the schedule that your team wrote in the project plan.</p></li>
        <li><p>Discuss technical risks and team concerns together and make plans to resolve them.</p></li>            
        </ol>
        
        <p>You may need to refer back to the Team Project Description in <a href="../lesson03/03-teach.html">03-Teach</a>.</p>
        
        <p>There is no team deliverable this week.</p>
