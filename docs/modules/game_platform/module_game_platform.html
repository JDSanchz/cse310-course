		<h1>Discovery Module - Writing a Game using a Platform</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Games bring entertainment and education to many people using their computers and devices.  However, we frequently don't realize the software code that is running behind those games.  Games have several components to them, including the following:       </p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>User Interface including Graphics and Sound</p></li>
        <li><p>Event Processing (Keyboard, Mouse)</p></li>
        <li><p>Game Logic and Story</p></li>
        <li><p>Network, Database and Notifications</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>With so many moving components in a game, it is useful to use a game platform for development.  There are several inluding  <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/">Lumberyard</a>, <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/">Unreal Engine</a>, <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/">Cryengine</a>, and <a href="https://urho3d.github.io/">Urho3D</a>.  Many of these platforms conatin professional tools for graphics and animation.  There are also several tools using Python including <a href="https://arcade.academy/">Arcade</a>, <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">PyGame</a>, <a href="https://kivy.org/">Kivy</a> and <a href="https://www.panda3d.org/">Panda3D</a>.</p>

		</ul>
		
		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
		<p>To complete this module, you need to do the following:</p>
		<ul>
            <li><p>Write a simple game with the following requirements:</p>
                
                <ul>
                <li><p>The game must be implemented using a game platform.</p></li>
                <li><p>The game should have either an entertainment or education purpose.</p></li>
                <li><p>The game should display graphics, take user input, and have moveable objects.</p></li>
                </ul>
            
            <li><p>The program needs to be published to a public GitHub repository as part of your personal programming portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in your repository should be well-documented with at least the following information:</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to set up the development environment including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to build (if applicable), execute, and use your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Explain the parts of the game platform that you used.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
                </ul>
		</ul>
        
                
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		
		<p>You can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Allow the user to save and load the game.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add music or sound effects to the game.</p></li>
            <li><p>Provide levels in your game that change the difficulty of the game.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository, and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
		
		<h2>Guidance</h2>
		
		<p>You should consider using Python and Arcade for this module.  Here are some useful notes when using this suggested environment:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>You need to install Arcade on your computer.  You can use pip to install: <code>pip install arcade</code>.
            <li><p>You should consider using Sprite classes in Arcade for any moving objects in the game.</p></li>
            <li><p>If you have any picture or sound files you want to include with your game, make sure they are in the same folder as your Python code.</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Here is a list of websites that you might find useful when working in the suggested environment:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p><a href="https://arcade.academy/examples/index.html">Arcade Examples</a> (official site)</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://realpython.com/arcade-python-game-framework/">Arcade Tutorial - RealPython</a> (tutorial site)</p></li>

		</ul>
