		<h1>Language Module - C++</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>The C++ language is an object oriented language that is used for embedded and application development.  The language is based on the C language.  C++ requires the use of compiler and linker which are operating system and processor specific.  C++ includes the Standard Template Library (STL) which provides support for data structures and threading.</p>

            <li><p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/">C++ Tutorial - W3Schools</a> (tutorial site)</p></li>

		</ul>
		
		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
		<p>To complete this module, you need to do the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Write <strong>three separate</strong> programs that collectively demonstrate the following:</p></li>
                
                <ul>
                <li><p>Variables</p></li>
                <li><p>Functions</p></li>
                <li><p>Expressions</p></li>
                <li><p>Loops</p></li>
                <li><p>Classes</p></li>
                <li><p>Data structure from STL (e.g. vector, list, or map)</p></li>
                </ul>
           
            <li><p>The programs need to be published to <strong>three separate</strong> public GitHub repository as part of your personal programming portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in your repository should be well-documented with at least the following information:</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to set up the development environment including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to build (if applicable), execute, and use your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Screenshots of your software running.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
                </ul>
		</ul>
        
                
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		
		<p>You can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Create <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/makefile/index.htm" target="_blank">makefiles</a>for each of your three programs</p></li>
            <li><p>Create a program or modify a program that demosntrates inheritance and virtual functions.</p></li>
            <li><p>Create a program or modify a program that uses an <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/links/libs">C++ external library</a></p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository, and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
		
		<h2>Guidance</h2>
		
        <p>There are multiple options for getting C++ including:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>Install <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Visual Studio (Free Community Version).  This is a different tool from Visual Studio Code.  Visual Studio inludes C++ tools.</a></p></li>
        <li><p>Install the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/" target="_blank">MinGW Gnu Compiler Collection (GCC)</a>.  You should make sure the compiler and linker tools are in your path.  You can compile from within the Visual Studio Code terminal window.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>There are online compilers available but you should install the required compilers to become aware of the development environment that will be required in future careers.</p>
		
		<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
		
		<p>This module will be graded as follows:</p>
		
		<table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 25%">Grade</th>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>100 (A)</td>
			  <td>All module requirements implemented correctly and a well-documented README.md file in GitHub.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>89 (B+)</td>
			  <td>All module requirements implemented correctly and a satisfactory README.md file in GitHub.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>79 (C+)</td>
			  <td>Most module requirements implemented correctly and a satisfactory README.md file in GitHub.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>0â€“69 (F/D+)</td>
			  <td>This module was not mastered.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
        
        <p>Up to a 10% bonus can be achieved by completing one of the stretch challenges.</p>
