        <h1>Module Descriptions</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>In this course, you will select multiple modules to complete individually. Available modules are listed at the bottom of this page.</p>

        <p>Each module will require you to use your current programming knowledge to learn new languages, tools, techniques, and libraries. During the first week of the course, you completed a Course Plan where you selected the modules you wanted to complete this semester. You are allowed to select different modules but you must make sure that the module you select is something that you have not previously learned (unless you plan to learn more advanced topics). Even though you can only select each module once during the semester, you can build upon software written for a previous module. For example, over three modules you could first learn Kotlin, then create an Android app with that Kotlin code, and then finally you can connect your Android app with a cloud database like Firestore.</p>

        <p>Each module will be completed in a two week Sprint. You will need to submit a plan during the first week. The plan document describes the expectation for time spent working on the module. By the end of the second week, you will need to submit your final product for the module. Your module will be graded based on your compliance to common and unique module requirements described below.</p>

        <h2>Common Requirements for all Modules</h2>

        <p>The software you write for each module has the following common requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You must write software of your own creation to demonstrate your understanding of the module. Submitting the code you wrote as part of a published tutorial online is not sufficient.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All code must be documented with useful comments.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The software must include a README.md file at the top folder of the project. The template for each README.md file written in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">Markdown Language</a> is different for each module and is provided in the detailed table below. You must fill out the template completely. This file will be publically viewable in GitHub so make sure to use good spelling, good grammar, and maintain professionalisim.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A 4-5 minute video demonstrating the execution of the software and a walkthrough of the code must be created and uploaded publicly (or unlisted if desired) to a site like YouTube. A link to the video must be included in the README.md file. The video should serve as a training video for someone else to learn what you learned.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All the code including the README.md file must be published in a public GitHub repository. Each module must be in a <strong>separate GitHub repository</strong>. The name of the repository should reflect the software you wrote (e.g. MenuPlanner) or the technology that you used (e.g. KotlinPractice). Don't use generic names like "Module1" or "CSE310Project2".</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are modifying software written in a previous module to support your new module, then you should reuse the same GitHub repository. However, the documentation and video need to be updated to reflect the changes made to your software by the new module. Included below is a description of each module.</p>

                        <p>The C++ language is an object-oriented language that is used for embedded and application development. It is based on the C language. C++ requires the use of a compiler and linker, which are operating systemâ€“ and processor-specific. C++ includes the Standard Template Library (STL), which provides support for data structures and threading.</p>

                        <p>The Java language is an object-oriented language that is used for embedded and application development. Java requires the use of a compiler and a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which can both be obtained by installing the Java Development Kit (JDK). Compiled code (often with a .class or .jar extension) will run on any computer that has a JVM. Java contains a substantial library which includes many classes for data structures (Java Collection Framework), file management, and threading. In Java, every file contains a single class. A static main function is created in one of the classes and is used to provide a starting point for the program.</p>

                        <p>The Kotlin language is an object-oriented language that is used for general application development including Android mobile app development. It is based on the Java language. Kotlin was designed to provide improvements to the Java language while still supporting the Java libraries. Library support includes data structures, file operations, and networking.</p>

                        <h4>Guidance</h4>
                        <p>To set up your development environment for Kotlin, complete the following:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>The Java Development Kit (JDK) is needed since Kotlin is built on top of it. Install the latest version of either <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html" target="_blank">JDK (commercial)</a> or <a href="https://jdk.java.net/" target="_blank">OpenJDK (open source)</a> from Oracle. In industry, there are license considerations between these two options. For your work in this course, either choice is acceptable. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Install <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">IntelliJ Idea (Free Community Version)</a>. This is an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Kotlin support will be installed automically. When you create a project in IntelliJ, select "Kotlin" and "JVM | IDEA". When you create files, select "Kotlin File/Class" to create .kt files.</p>

                        <h4>Module</h4>
                        <p>R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.</p>
                        <p>R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, â€¦) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.</p>
                        <p>One of Râ€™s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.</p>
                        <p>R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundationâ€™s GNU General Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.</p>

                        <h4>Module</h4>
                        <p>The Erlang language is an example of functional languages like Haskell, F#, and Clojure. Functional languages (unlike the imperative languages you have learned previously) have the following characterstics:</p>

                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                <p>Functions are designed to produce an output from the inputs.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Variables are immutable since functions are only tasked with producing a result. When dealing with data structures, this means that when we add or remove something we will either reuse parts of the previous structure or we will need to recreate parts of the structure.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Since functions are only concerned with the current task and also since variables are immutable, there are no side effects from our code. A side effect occurs when running a funciton or changing a variable affects other variables and functions. Side effects are common in object oriented programming (member functions affect member data).</p>
                            </li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>The goal with functional programming is to write code with higher quality due to the strictness of the language. Like Python, the Erlang language determines variable types automatically. Other languages like Haskell are strictly typed.</p>

                        <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages â€” every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at â€” displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. â€” you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>

                        <p>The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in a variable called name.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. "Player 1: Chris".</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example above to detect when the label is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>And much more!</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top of the client-side JavaScript language. So-called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.</p>

                        <p>APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement. They do the same thing for programming that ready-made furniture kits do for home building â€” it is much easier to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a bookshelf than it is to work out the design yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to the right size and shape, find the correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a bookshelf.</p>

                        <p>C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers. This tour provides an overview of the major components of the language in C# 11 and earlier. If you want to explore the language through interactive examples, try the introduction to C# tutorials.</p>

                        <p>C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming language. C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software components. Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software design practices. At its core, C# is an object-oriented language. You define types and their behavior.</p>

                        <p>Several C# features help create robust and durable applications. Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects. Nullable types guard against variables that don't refer to allocated objects. Exception handling provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery. Lambda expressions support functional programming techniques. Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax creates a common pattern for working with data from any source. Language support for asynchronous operations provides syntax for building distributed systems. C# has a unified type system. All C# types, including primitive types such as int and double, inherit from a single root object type. All types share a set of common operations. Values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner. Furthermore, C# supports both user-defined reference types and value types. C# allows dynamic allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures. C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance. C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code.</p>

                        <p>C# emphasizes versioning to ensure programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner. Aspects of C#'s design that were directly influenced by versioning considerations include the separate virtual and override modifiers, the rules for method overload resolution, and support for explicit interface member declarations.</p>

                        <p>The Rust language is used for embedded and application development. While similair to C or C++, it has improvements including memory management and variable ownership. Support is provided for object-oriented methodologies as well as data structures and threading. Rust comes with a build environment called Cargo which is used both for library management and building.</p>

                        <p>Cloud data storage is a convenient solution which removes the requirement for an individual or company to maintain their own database server. Tools like <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Firebase</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> will provide you a database which you can access using an API (function calls from a library). The use of these cloud databases is frequently free for simple projects, but will cost when scaled up. Cloud databases provide a mix of various types of databases, including relational and key/value. A key/value database (which is recommended in the instructions) will store data into maps that can be queried either in whole, in parts, or in filtered parts. A key/value database is also commonly called a NoSQL database. The APIs for each database will vary and provide these capabilities. </p>

                            <li>
                                <p>You will need to create a free Firebase account, create a Firebase project, and create a Firestore database in the project.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>During the process of getting your account and database set up, you will need to download a Service Account File, which is a JSON file. This file along with the project name will be needed when you initialize your connection to the Firestore database within your code. The Service Account File is secret and should not be shared in the GitHub repository.</p>
                            </li>

                        <p>As the processing power of computers has increased, the world has become able to capture the large amounts of data that it produces. Surveys, transactions, and observations are captured every hour of every day. A data scientist has the skills to capture, organize, and analyze large amounts of data and look for patterns, trends, and statistical relevance between datasets. Since the possibilities of data analysis are endless, programming languages are used to write customized software to analyze data. Some languages, like R, were designed specifically for data analysis. Libraries like <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Pandas</a>, <a href="https://numpy.org/" target="_blank">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">Matplotlib</a>, <a href="https://scrapy.org/" target="_blank">Scrapy</a>, <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" target="_blank">BeautifulSoup</a>, and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a> provide the capabilities to do the analysis with the familar Python programming language.</p>

                        <p>Games bring entertainment and education to many people using their computers and devices. However, we frequently don't realize the software code that is running behind those games. Games have several components to them, including the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>User Interface including Graphics and Sound</p>

                            <li>
                                <p>Event Processing (Keyboard, Mouse)</p>
                            </li>

                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>With so many moving components in a game, it is useful to use a game platform for development.

                        <p>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) involves the organization of information on a map. The information can be physical (cities, landmarks, mountains, trails), economic (median incomes, tax rates, employment), social (gender, ethnicity, family, religion), or event driven (earthquake, lightning, crime, activity). Using maps, decisions can be made, trends can be found, and information can be obtained. The components in GIS include user interfaces, data storage, and analysis.</p>

                        <p>Mobile is everywhere, and the ability to make mobile applications has never been more sought after or desirable than it is now. Android applications are typically written in Java or Kotlin using Android Studio. iOS applications are written in Swift using XCode (using a Mac).</p>

                        <p>Other platforms have been created to make it easier to port to multiple platforms. React Native uses JavaScript to create apps that will run on both platforms. Flutter uses the Dart language to achieve the same result.</p>

                        <p>Communication between two computers (or even two pieces of software on the same computer) can be done using the networking stack. A network is more than just physical wire (or wireless) that connects a computer to a network; it also includes the data that is transmitted through that connection. The data is organized into layers according to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. These layers include the physical, datalink, network, and transport layers. These layers are used to package, route, and transmit data between computers. Common transport layers include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). On top of all of these layers is the data that we actually want to communicate to another computer. This data is frequently organized by a message structure that both the sending computer and receiving computer understand. Defined formats like JSON, HTML, or XML are all commonly used.</p>

                        <p>Any information can be sent on a network connection. The software could be collaborative (e.g. chat), problem-solving (e.g. provide answer to question), content based (e.g. file or web server), or embedded (e.g. request data from a sensor or turn on a light).</p>

                        <p>When developing networking software, there are two types of models we can look at:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Client-Server: The server receives requests from many clients, processes each one, and sends the responses back to the client.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Peer-to-Peer: A computer (peer) communicates directly to another commputer without going through a server. In this model, there may be a server that is used by a computer to get address information for the other computer.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                <p>You will need to run two programs at the same time to test your software. It may be easier to run these programs on separate computers that have different IP addresses. If you don't have this option, you might consider installing a <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">virtual machine</a> running <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop" target="_blank">Linux</a>, or configuring your software to send and receive on different ports.</p>

                        <p>Data can be stored in many different formats. An efficient method for storing information is in a database. One common type of database is a relational database, which organizes the data into tables and relates them together using keys. Libraries have been written to make it easy for the programmer to read and write to and from these databases. Most relational databases support Structured Query Language, or SQL. SQL is a language that allows the programmer to easily interact with the database. Examples of relational databases include the following: <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/" target="_blank">Oracle</a>, <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft SQL Server</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html" target="_blank">SQLite</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/db2-database" target="_blank">IBM DB2</a>.</p>

                        <h4>Module</h4>
                        <p>This module will have you create a web app using a framework that will generate web pages dynamically on the host server. Django for Python and Node or React for JavaScript are two common examples of web app frameworks.</p>

                        <p>When a request is made to your web app, the Django framework will call the appropriate Python code (a function in your <code>views.py</code>) file). The Python code will then parse the request and prepare a response. To prepare a response, your code might read a database, download some data from another web server, or perform some calculations. To produce the response, a template HTML file is populated with data created by the Python function. The response is then automatically sent back by the Django framework. Using a framework can reduce the time it takes to create web content. In the case of Django, you also have the benefit of using the Python programming language to process requests.
