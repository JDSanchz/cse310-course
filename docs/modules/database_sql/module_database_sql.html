		<h1>Module - Relational Database with SQL</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Data can be stored in many different formats.  An efficient method for storing information is in a database.  One common type of database is a relational database, which organizes the data into tables and relates them together using keys.  Libraries have been written to make it easy for the programmer to read and write to and from these databases.  Most relational databases support Structured Query Language, or SQL.  SQL is a language that allows the programmer to easily interact with the database.  Examples of relational databases include the following:  <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/">Oracle</a>, <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx">Microsoft SQL Server</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/db2-database">IBM DB2</a>.</p>
			
		<p>You can read more about relational databases and SQL at sites including the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">Wikipedia - Relational Databases</a> (open collaboration site)</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-a-relational-database/">Oracle - Relational Databases</a> (company sponsored site)</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/">W3Schools - SQL</a> (tutorial site)</p></li>
		<li></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
		<p>To complete this module, you need to do the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Write a program that interacts with a relational database using SQL.  The purpose of the program and the type of data stored are up to you.  The program can be written in any programming language and use any relational database.  See the notes below for guidance about this step.</p></li>
		<li><p>Create a database for your program to use, including at least one table to store the data.</p></li>
		<li><p>The program should demonstrate the following capabilities working with the database:</p></li>
			<ul>
			<li><p>Insert new data into a table.</p></li>
			<li><p>Modify existing data in the table.</p></li>
			<li><p>Delete existing data from the table.</p></li>
			<li><p>Retrieve (that is, query) data from the table.</p></li>
			</ul>
		<li><p>The program needs to be published to a public GitHub repository as part of your personal programming portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in your repository should be well documented, with at least the following information:</p></li>
			<ul>
			<li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
			<li><p>How to set up the development environment including the database.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
			<li><p>How to build (if applicable), execute, and use your program.</p></li>
			<li><p>Description of the SQL commands you used in the program.</p></li>
			<li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
        
                
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		
		<p>You can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>TBD 1</p></li>
            <li><p>TBD 2</p></li>
            <li><p>TBD 3</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository, and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
		
		<h2>Guidance</h2>
		
		<p>You should consider using Python and PostgreSQL for this module.  Here are some useful notes when using this suggested environment:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>You need to install PostgreSQL on your computer.  Installation instructions can be found on the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL website</a>.</p></li>
			<li><p>When you install PostgreSQL, you will be prompted to create an administrator password.  It is very important that you save this password so you can access the SQL Shell for setup and debugging.  The SQL Shell (also called psql) is installed with PostgreSQL.  The SQL Shell supports SQL commands as well as specific commands (they start with a backward slash \) to help you navigate the database.  You should refer to the PostgreSQL website or one of the tutorials below to learn how to use these commands.</p></li>
			<li><p>Use <code>psycopg</code> to access a PostgreSQL database from Python.  You can use pip to install: <code>pip install psycopg2</code></p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Here is a list of websites that you might find useful when working in the suggested environment:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> (official site)</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://www.psycopg.org/">psycopg</a> (official site)</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/">TutorialsPoint - PostgreSQL</a> (tutorial site)</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-python/">PostgreSQL tutorial using psycopg</a> (tutorial site)</p></li>	
		</ul>
