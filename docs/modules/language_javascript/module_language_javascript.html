		<h1>Language Module - JavaScript</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>

		<p>If you have previous experience (e.g. courses, employment, hobbies) programming in JavaScript, then you should <strong>not</strong> complete this module.</p>

        <p>TBD</p>
			
		<p>You can read more from sites like the following:</p>
		<ul>
		    <li><p><a href="">Site</a> (company sponsored site, tutorial site, official site, open collaboration site)</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
		<p>To complete this module, you need to do the following:</p>
		<ul>
            <!-- SAMPLE - Need at least instructions to build something that demonstrate specific things

            <li><p>Write a program that interacts with a relational database using SQL.  The purpose of the program and the type of data stored is up to you.  The program can be written in any programming language and use any relational database.  See the notes below for guidance about this step.</p></li>
            <li><p>Create a database for your program to use including at least one table to store the data.</p></li>
            <li><p>The program should demonstrate the following capabilities working with the database:</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Insert new data into a table.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Modify existing data in the table.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Delete existing data from the table.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Retrieve (e.g., query) data from the table.</p></li>
                </ul>
            -->
            
            <li><p>The program needs to be published to a public GitHub repository as part of your personal programming portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in your repository should be well documented with at least the following information:</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to setup the development environment including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to build (if applicable), execute, and use your program.</p></li>
                    
                    <!-- SAMPLE - Any unique things related to this module
                    <li><p>Description of the SQL commands you used in the program.</p></li>
                    -->
                    
                    <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
                </ul>
		</ul>
        
                
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		
		<p>You can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>TBD 1</p></li>
            <li><p>TBD 2</p></li>
            <li><p>TBD 3</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The implementaiton of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
		
		<h2>Guidance</h2>
		
        <!-- SAMPLE: Suggest certain environment to use and provide some high level instructions and useful websites:
		<p>You should consider using Python and PostgreSQL for this module.  Here are some useful notes when using this suggested environment:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>You need to install PostgreSQL on your computer.  Installation instructions can be found on the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> website.</p></li>
			<li><p>When you install PostgreSQL, you will be prompted to create an administrator password.  It is very important that you save this password so you can access the SQL Shell for setup and debugging.  The SQL Shell (also called psql) is installed with PostgreSQL.  The SQL Shell supports SQL commands as well as specific commands (they start with a backward slash) to help you navigate the database.  You should refer to the PostgreSQL website or one of the tutorials below to learn how to use these commands.</p></li>
			<li><p>Use <code>psycopg</code> to access a PostgreSQL database from Python.  You can use pip to install: <code>pip install psycopg2</code></p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Here is a list of websites that you might find useful when working in these suggested environment:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> (official site)</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://www.psycopg.org/">psycopg</a> (official site)</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/">TutorialsPoint - PostgreSQL</a> (tutorial site)</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-python/">PostgreSQL tutorial using psycopg</a> (tutorial site)</p></li>	
		</ul>
        -->
