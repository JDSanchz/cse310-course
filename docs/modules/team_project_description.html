		<h1>Team Project Description</h1>
        
        <h2>Your Team</h2>
        
        <p>You have been placed into a team with other students.&nbsp;The purpose of this team is to do three things:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Demonstrate your individual ability to contribute, communicate, and resolve conflicts with other students.</p></li>
        <li><p>Facilitate the requirement to develop a larger project using one or more of the discovery modules in this course.</p></li>
        <li><p>Provide an opportunity to share your own ideas, experiences, and conclusions with other students.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
                
        <p>Your team will propose a software project to complete over the remaining weeks of this course.  The project should have the following characteristics:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>The project should provide value to those who either use the software or benefit from the results of the software.  Your teacher may give you a project theme.</p></li>
        <li><p>The project should make use of one or more of the discovery modules.  It is acceptable to build upon something that a team member has already started from one of their own discovery modules.  For example, your project could contain one or more of the following components:</p></li>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Android App or Web App front end (depending on the project, it may be acceptable to have a simple command line interface)</p></li>
            <li><p>Interactive Game</p></li>
            <li><p>Interactive Maps</p></li>
            <li><p>Integration with a SQL or Cloud Database</p></li>
            <li><p>Client/Server or Peer-to-Peer Networking</p></li>            
            <li><p>Data Processing including statstical analysis (perhaps the output of the project is a report of findings)</p></li>
            </ul>
        <li><p>The project should be large enough to provide a challenge over the remaining weeks of the course.&nbsp;However, the project should not be so large that it cannot be accomplished.</p>
        </li><li><p>The project should be interesting enough to showcase to employers in a resume, at a job fair, or during interviews.</p></li>
        <li><p>The project may use additional students from different departments (i.e. it can be an interdisciplinary project).</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The project must be configured in a public GitHub repository with a well-documented README.md file.</p>
        

        <h2>Schedule</h2>
        
        <p>The schedule for the project is as follows:</p>
        
        <table>
        <tr>
          <th style="width: 25%">Course Week</th><th style="width: 75%">Activity</th></tr>
        <tr><td>3</td><td>Create Team Contract</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4</td><td>Create Project Plan (includes proposal)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>5</td><td>Work on Project — No Deliverable</td></tr>
        <tr><td>6</td><td>Provide Status Report #1</td></tr>            
        <tr><td>7</td><td>Work on Project — No Deliverable</td></tr>            
        <tr><td>8</td><td>Provide Status Report #2</td></tr>            
        <tr><td>9</td><td>Work on Project — No Deliverable</td></tr>            
        <tr><td>10</td><td>Provide Status Report #3</td></tr>            
        <tr><td>11</td><td>Work on Project — No Deliverable</td></tr>                        
        <tr><td>12</td><td>Provide Project Demo</td></tr>            
        <tr><td>13</td><td>Work on Project — No Deliverable</td></tr>

        </table>
        
        <h2>Expectations</h2>
        
        <p>You may feel frustrated that your grade in this course is dependent on other people. However, you must realize that your success in a career, including your ability to provide for your families and build Zion in your communities, will rely directly upon the performance of you and others. While the penalties in college are restricted to grades, the penalties in the workforce will include the loss of trust and employment.</p>

        <ol>
        <li><p>The team must meet at least once per week. Each team member must commit to attending all team meetings. If there is an emergency that prevents you from attending a team meeting, then you must notify your team. Failure to attend team meetings regularly will result in a lower individual grade. Additionally, failure to attend team meetings regularly will reduce the ability of the team to succeed.</p></li>
        <li><p>This is a programming class. Each team member must commit to developing an equal amount of code on the project. It is not acceptable to have a team member focus on non-software activities only. Failure to do your equal share of coding will result in a lower individual grade. Additionally, failure to do your equal share of coding will reduce the ability of the team to succeed.</p></li>
        <li><p>You must dedicate the required time each week to complete all the required activities which you have committed to in your life. It is important that you balance your schedule so none of these activities is sacrificed. Failure to dedicate time for your team project will result in a lower individual grade. Additionally, failure to dedicate time for your team project will reduce the ability for the team to succeed.</p></li>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Assignments given to you in your team (about 4–5 hours a week)</p></li>
            <li><p>Completion of individual discovery and language modules in the course (about 4–5 hours a week)</p></li>
            <li><p>Completion of other courses you are taking this semester</p></li>
            <li><p>Family commitments</p></li>
            <li><p>Work commitments</p></li>
            <li><p>Church commitments</p></li>
            </ul>                
        <li><p>You must recognize if you are getting overwhelmed with work in your life. It is important to speak to your spouse, a family member, a friend, a team member, your teacher, a counselor, or a church leader if you find yourself having difficulty. Failure to talk to others when you are struggling may result in difficulty keeping other commitments, including personal commitments. Your emotional health is just as important as your spiritual and physical health. You must be proactive and ask for help.</p></li>
        <li><p>A successful team is built upon the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. You are expected to individually do your part to ensure that the Holy Ghost is included in all your team’s work. Consistent team and individual prayer is essential to invite the Spirit into your work. Consider the following scriptures frequently as you work together:</p></li>

        <h2>Rubric</h2>
        
        <p>Your team project will be given a grade according to the following rubric, with only five possible numeric grades (there is no scale):</p>
        
        <table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 25%">Grade</th>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>100 (A)</td>
			  <td>Project is completed and demonstrates mastery of relevant discovery modules.  The README.md file is well-documented.  A potential employer would be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>89 (B+)</td>
              <td>Project is mostly completed and demonstrates understanding of the relevant discovery modules <strong>OR</strong> the README.md file is missing or lacking detail.  A potential employer might be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview. You should look for opportunities to improve your software and documentation.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>75 (C)</td>
              <td>Project is partially completed and demonstrates partial understanding of the relevant discovery modules.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>       
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>60 (D-)</td>
			  <td>Project was attempted but is mostly incomplete.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.  You should consider either retaking the course or spending time after the course to reattempt the project.  These actions are important to prepare you for future interviews.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0 (F)</td>
