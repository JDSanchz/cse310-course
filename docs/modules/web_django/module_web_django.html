		<h1>Discovery Module - Web Sites using Django</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Django is a Python library that is used to create a web app with dynamically generated websites.  When a request is made to your web app, the Django framework will call the appropriate Python code (a function in your <code>views.py</code>) file).  The Python code will then parse the request and prepare a response.  To prepare a response, your code might read a database, download some data from another web server, or perform some calculations.  To produce the response, a template HTML file is populated with data created by the Python function.  The response is then automatically sent back by the Django framework.  Using a framework can reduce the time it takes to create web content.  In the case of Django, you also have the benefit of using the Python programming language to process requests.

		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
		<p>To complete this module, you need to do the following:</p>
		<ul>
            <li><p>Write a Web App that has at least four web pages using Python and Django.   Each of the four web pages should be represented by a Python function in the <code>views.py</code> file.  In summary, your app should support at least the following URL's when running on your local machine with the default port:</p>            </li>
                
                <ul>
                <li><p>http://127.0.0.1:8000/app_name/page_name_1</p></li>
                <li><p>http://127.0.0.1:8000/app_name/page_name_2</p></li>
                <li><p>http://127.0.0.1:8000/app_name/page_name_3</p></li>
                <li><p>http://127.0.0.1:8000/app_name/page_name_4</p></li>
                </ul>

            <li><p>The purpose of the program is up to you. The web sites should take inputs from the user and provide a response based on those inputs.  The task that is performed should be meaningful.</p></li>
            <li><p>The web app should run on your local computer using the built-in web server provided by Django.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>The program needs to be published to a public GitHub repository as part of your personal programming portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in your repository should be well-documented with at least the following information:</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to set up the development environment including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to build (if applicable), execute, and use your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
                </ul>
		</ul>
        
                
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		
		<p>You can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Create a database (i.e. model) using Django and have your web pages read and write from it.</p></li>
            <li><p>Use sessions in Django to remember user data with cookies.</p></li>
            <li><p>Deploy your Web App on a web server like Heroku.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
		
		<h2>Guidance</h2>
		
		<p>For this module, you must use Python and Django.  In addition to the tutorials in the overview section above, the following notes may be useful to you:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>You can use pip to install Django: <code>pip install Django</code></p></li>
            <li><p>Django projects have several files which do not need to be manually written.  The following commands are useful:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><code>django-admin startproject my_project_name</code> - This will create the initial project files</p></li>
                <li><p><code>python manage.py startapp my_app_name</code> - This will create an app in your project</p></li>
                <li><p><code>python manage.py runserver</code> - This will start your web app.  You will need to open a web browser to open the web pages.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
		
		<p>This module will be graded as follows:</p>
