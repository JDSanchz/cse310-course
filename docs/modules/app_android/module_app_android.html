		<h1>Discovery Module - Creating an Android App</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Did you know that there are close to three million applications in the Google Play Store? Did you also know that the average Android developer makes well over <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/android-developer/salaries">100k/year</a>? Android is everywhere, and the ability to make Android applications has never been more sought after or desirable as it is now. Android applications are typically written in Java using Android Studio, and while many applications are published to the Google Play Store or other application markets, developers are able to create applications and distribute them without such deployments. This module is intended for you to learn how to develop Android applications quickly using Flutter.</p>
		<p>You can read more from sites such as the following:</p>
		<ul>
				<li><p><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25099/android-app">Android Apps</a></p></li>
				<li><p><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a></p></li>
				<li><p><a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter: build beautiful, natively compiled mobile apps</a></p></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		<p>To complete this module, you need to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
				<li><p>Create a native android application using Android Studio</p></li>
				<li><p>This application should:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>be deployed as an <a href="https://fileinfo.com/extension/apk">apk</a></p></li>
						<li><p>run successfully on an Android device</p></li>
						<li><p>be helpful in performing a task that you, or someone you know, do on a frequent basis</p></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
            <li><p>The program needs to be published to a public GitHub repository as part of your personal programming portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in your repository should be well-documented with at least the following information:</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to set up the development environment including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to build (if applicable), execute, and use your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Screenshots of your software running.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
                </ul>
		</ul>
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		<p>You can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Give your application a professional look and feel</p></li>
            <li><p>Use something in Android that requires permission (for example: location, camera, microphone, etc.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Store data either in local storage or in Firebase</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository, and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
