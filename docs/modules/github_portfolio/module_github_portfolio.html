		<h1>Discovery Module - Creating a Personal Software Portfolio</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>TBD - Consider using Android Studio and Flutter and Kotlin (official documentation from Android is better for Kotlin)</p>
        
		<p>You can read more from sites such as the following:</p>
		<ul>
            <li><p><a href="">Site</a> (company sponsored site, tutorial site, official site, open collaboration site)</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
		<p>To complete this module, you need to do the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <!-- SAMPLE - Need at least instructions to build something that demonstrate specific things

            <li><p>Write a simple game with the following requirements:</p></li>
                
                <ul>
                <li><p>The game must be implemented using a game platform.</p></li>
                <li><p>The game should have either an entertainment or education purpose.</p></li>
                <li><p>The game should display graphics, take user input, and have moveable objects.</p></li>
                </ul>
           
            -->
        
            <li><p>The program needs to be published to a public GitHub repository as part of your personal programming portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in your repository should be well-documented with at least the following information:</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to set up the development environment including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to build (if applicable), execute, and use your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Screenshots of your software running.</p></li>
                    
                    <!-- SAMPLE - Any unique things related to this module
                    <li><p>Description of the SQL commands you used in the program.</p></li>
                    -->
                    
                    <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
                </ul>
		</ul>
        
                
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		
		<p>You can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>TBD 1</p></li>
            <li><p>TBD 2</p></li>
            <li><p>TBD 3</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository, and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
		
		<h2>Guidance</h2>
    
        <!-- SAMPLE: Suggest certain environment to use and provide some high level instructions and useful websites:
		
		<p>You should consider using Python and Arcade for this module.  Here are some useful notes when using this suggested environment:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>You need to install Arcade on your computer.  You can use pip to install: <code>pip install arcade</code>.</p></li>
            <li><p>You should consider using Sprite classes in Arcade for any moving objects in the game.</p></li>
            <li><p>If you have any picture or sound files you want to include with your game, make sure they are in the same folder as your Python code.</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Here is a list of websites that you might find useful when working in the suggested environment:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p><a href="https://arcade.academy/examples/index.html"  target="_blank">Arcade Examples</a> (official site)</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://realpython.com/arcade-python-game-framework/"  target="_blank">Arcade Tutorial - RealPython</a> (tutorial site)</p></li>

		</ul>
